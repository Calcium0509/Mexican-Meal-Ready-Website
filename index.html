        <h1>Mission Statemet</h1>
        <p>My brand, Mexican meal ready’s mission statement is “Easy ready to make yummy and affordable Mexican food”. (currently only selling tacos) If you wish to buy a meal-kit, go to My website at https/Mexican Meal Ready.com. Don’t actually Luke that link won’t work, use the file I send you. On my website you have a large selection of authentic easy to make Mexican food, ranging for tacos to… nothing else. But if there were more, they would be just as high quality as the tacos. My company was made to give family’s everywhere around the world amazing authentic Mexican food, following real Mexican recipes. What makes our company different from others is the price. For only 45 dollars you can get 8 servings. Most company’s cost 9 to 11 dollars per serving, if we used them prices our meal kit cost would cost up to 80 dollars. Affordability is our highest priority, while being easy to make and prep only taking 10 minutes to cook and 5 minutes to prep and serve. All the ingredients, in correct portion size and with all items correctly stored in line with the Australian Food Standards, to ensure food safety and hygiene.</p>

                <p>Ground Beef Tacos is one of our favorite weeknight family meals, especially on Taco Tuesdays! A quick homemade taco seasoning that I love to use for this recipe so I can cook the taco meat in 10 minutes. Give it a try and it’ll be your new go-to for taco night too!<p>
